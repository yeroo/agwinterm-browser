description: antithesis — the strongest case against a filed item, and whether something simpler reaches the same goal
---
## Lens: antithesis

Make the case *against*, at full strength. The author has already made the case for it, and a
maintainer reading only that decides with one side of the argument in front of him.

- is the need real but rare? One user's request, already met by a workaround that exists, is usually a
  documentation fix rather than a feature
- does it belong here at all? Every project has a boundary, and a request that quietly widens what the
  thing is for costs more than the code it adds
- what does it commit the project to: a setting that can never be withdrawn, a behavior users will
  depend on, a promise about something outside the maintainer's control
- who pays for it afterwards — the reader of the code, the person answering the support question it
  creates, the next person changing the area it touches
- if the item proposes a design, does a simpler one reach the same goal? Name the simpler one
  concretely and say what the proposed design buys over it. "Simpler" with no alternative named is not
  an argument
- is there a smaller thing that captures most of the value, and would it close this item or merely
  postpone it

Argue against the item and stay honest about its strongest point: name the one thing that would change
your mind and the evidence that would establish it. An objection nothing could answer is a position
rather than an argument, and a maintainer learns nothing from it.

The case is against the change, never against the person who filed it.

**If you cannot read the code or the project's history, report that as a finding of its own, first.**
An item nothing argues against and an item whose objections you could not check produce the same
silence, and the maintainer reads that silence as consent. Name the command that failed and what it
printed.
