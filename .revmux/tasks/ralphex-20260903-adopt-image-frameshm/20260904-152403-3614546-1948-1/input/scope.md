# Review scope (handed over by ralphex)

This round was opened automatically by ralphex's external review phase for the
task it just implemented. Everything below is ralphex's own review prompt,
verbatim — it carries the goal, the exact diff command for this iteration, and
the paths to the plan and the progress log.

Review the diff it names. The plan file states what the task was supposed to do;
a change that works but does not match the plan is a finding worth reporting.

You are reviewing code changes for: implementation of plan at C:\Users\boris\source\winterm-browser\docs\plans\20260903-adopt-image-frameshm.md

## Get the Diff

Run this command to see the changes:
git diff main...HEAD

## Review Focus

Analyze the code for:

1. Bugs and logic errors - incorrect behavior, edge cases, null/nil handling
2. Security issues - injection, XSS, secrets exposure, improper validation
3. Race conditions - concurrent access, shared state, missing synchronization
4. Error handling - silent failures, ignored errors, missing fallbacks
5. Test coverage - missing tests, inadequate edge case coverage
6. Code quality - unnecessary complexity, poor naming, unclear logic

## Output Format

Report issues as a structured list:

- file:line - description of issue
- file:line - description of issue

If no issues found, output: NO ISSUES FOUND

## Previous Review History

Check the progress log at C:\Users\boris\source\winterm-browser\.ralphex\progress\progress-20260903-adopt-image-frameshm-codex.txt for previous review iterations and findings history before reporting issues.

## Important

- Focus on real problems, not style preferences
- Check if issues are already mitigated in the code
- Only report issues you can verify by reading the actual code
- Be specific about file paths and line numbers
